## Instructions

### Configuration changes
* Setting up clientId, clientSecret, botId, botName and identity in BotConfig.tsx file

#Client id - Copy this id from Bot Builder SDK Settings ex. cs-5250bdc9-6bfe-5ece-92c9-ab54aa2d4285

#Client secret - copy this value from Bot Builder SDK Settings ex. Wibn3ULagYyq0J10LCndswYycHGLuIWbwHvTRSfLwhs=
 
#User identity - This should represent the subject for JWT token that could be an email or phone number in case of known user. In case of anonymous user, this can be a randomly generated unique id.

#Bot name - copy this value from Bot Builder -> Channels -> Web/Mobile SDK config  ex. "Demo Bot"

#Bot Id - copy this value from Bot Builder -> Channels -> Web/Mobile SDK config  ex. st-acecd91f-b009-5f3f-9c15-7249186d827d

#Server URL - replace it with your server URL, if required

#Anonymous user - if not anonymous, assign same identity (such as email or phone number) while making a connection.

#JWT Server URL - specify the server URL for JWT token generation. This token is used to authorize the SDK client. Refer to documentation on how to setup the JWT server for token generation - e.g. https://jwt-token-server.example.com/

 ```
export const botConfig: BotConfigModel = {
  botName: 'Bot name here',
  botId: 'Bot id here',
  clientId: 'client id here',
  clientSecret: 'client secret here',
  botUrl: 'https://platform.kore.ai',//change url here
  identity: uuid.v4() + '',//change identity here
  isWebHook: false,// For now this should be always false as web hook support is not yet available in react-native sdk
};

```

### Running the Demo app
*	Download or clone the repository.
*	Import the project.
*	npm install --legacy-peer-deps
*	Run Android app - npx react-native run-android.
*	Run iOS app - ios/pod install & npx react-native run-ios
  
# How to integrate react-native BotSDK through npm
